  I decided to begin writing about ultimate after observing the unique challenges of playing in Shanghai. Unlike in the US, where most players learn the game by joining a structured team during college or even high school, the majority of players in China rely on weekly open practices to gain experience. However, due to the broad range of skill levels, most of the time is spent scrimmaging. It’s tough to maintain continuity when teaching new concepts here, especially with the high turnover of expats and the many locals playing for the first time. Let’s not even mention the language barrier.
    While there are a number of ultimate-focused resources online, I struggled to find a great source for learning fundamental ultimate strategy. The websites I found were either targeted toward true beginners (“what are the rules of the game?”) or elite club players (e.g. The Huddle). My target audience consists of those who find themselves somewhere in between.
  I consider myself lucky to have had a wonderful coach during my four years playing on Harvard’s Red Line, and for those who haven’t had the experience of playing on a coached team before (or even if you have!), I hope you’ll learn something new for the next time you play.
